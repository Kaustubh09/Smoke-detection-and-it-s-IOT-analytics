# Smoke-detection-and-it-s-IOT-analytics
Air pollution sensors can help people control our environments to a certain extent and increase awareness of the pollutants around them. If people are more aware of the contents of the environment, they can change their routines and habits in order to be less effected by air pollution. In our project first we will get the value of the amount of air pollutants  like smoke,methane ,hydrogen using MQ2 sensor and then we will transfer these values to the cloud so that the normal person can see it.Also using wifi network protocol a message will be sent in the mobile number of the user who is far away but within the wifi range of the module  if the pollution level in the air exceeds a certain amount.And at the end we will do IOT analytics of the readings using graphs generated from these readings.After the implementation of this project even the user from a far away location  can know the pollution level of that  location.Along with this using cloud and tableau software we can do IOT analytics
